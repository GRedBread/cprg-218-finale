                    <p><strong>Featured Song:</strong> Lace It</p>
                    <p>The Party Never Ends 2.0 brings an evolved, high-energy experience with its infectious beats and vibrant production. The album captures the thrill of nonstop celebration while exploring deeper themes of excess, escapism, and self-discovery, all while maintaining an electrifying atmosphere.</p>

                    <h3>Out By 12</h3>
                    <p><strong>Featured Song:</strong> Finale</p>
                    <p>This album falls short of expectations, offering little in terms of new ideas. While it has some strong moments, the overall experience feels repetitive and lacking in innovation.</p>
